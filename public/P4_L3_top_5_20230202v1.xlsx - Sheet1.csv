I've been using this FAB cream for almost a decade. I have spent thousands of dollars on just this one cream - I've got a whole family with sensitive skin and we live in an area with very harsh winters. We've bought uncounted tubes and tubs of this stuff (as well as now-discontinued fragrances, rip coconut lime). This used to be the absolute best cream you could buy for a variety of concerns - dry skin, acne, eczema, flakiness, EVERYTHING. The scent was pleasant and the texture, once it sunk in, left your skin actually soft but never greasy and weird. Holy Grail, totally deserving of every accolade it received. 

Welp. Over the last year that's almost all changed. The fragrance is more or less the same, but I suddenly noticed my hands and face weren't staying as nice as they used to. My family agrees: the cream isn't soothing eczema or flakiness anymore, nor helping prevent dryness. The texture is no longer thick and luscious but feels watery and insubstantial when applied. Once it's rubbed in, skin now seems mildly tacky, not soft or moisturized. Any sensation of moisture wears off quickly. 

I can't tell what they've done to the formula besides the addition of eucalyptus, but it is a catastrophic change. This product used to be five stars, now it's one. A pump bottle of any drugstore brand with oatmeal will serve you much better. I also want to note they have raised the price on the 8oz tube by TWELVE DOLLARS over the last six years - and I'd still be willing to pay if it wasn't worse than a drugstore product. But as it stands I'm heartbroken. Don't waste your money.",4

I have to say, I love FAB products! I’ve tried a lot (more on the dry skin range) and everything has been great. This is my holy grail moisturizer.

It’s really amazing and calming for my very dry skin. Haven’t had any issues with it. And a decent price for what it is and how much you can get. One of the rare items I have bought ten times.",1

i don’t understand why fab markets this as a repair cream. it’s a nicely hydrating moisturizer that isn’t thick or greasy and it gets the job done. but the inclusion of eucalyptus oil just ruins the whole moisturizer imo. i’ve been using this for a couple of days, the first time i tried it, it stung a bit around my nose & chin but i ignored it bc i was also exfoliating that night. today, my skin feels very sensitized and my products have started to sting so i’ve decided to stop using it :/ first aid beauty if by any chance you’re reading sephora reviews please remove the eucalyptus oil from this moisturizer it’s defeating the whole purpose of being a repairing cream!!!",11

I've been using this FAB cream for almost a decade. I have spent thousands of dollars on just this one cream - I've got a whole family with sensitive skin and we live in an area with very harsh winters. We've bought uncounted tubes and tubs of this stuff (as well as now-discontinued fragrances, rip coconut lime). This used to be the absolute best cream you could buy for a variety of concerns - dry skin, acne, eczema, flakiness, EVERYTHING. The scent was pleasant and the texture, once it sunk in, left your skin actually soft but never greasy and weird. Holy Grail, totally deserving of every accolade it received. 

Welp. Over the last year that's almost all changed. The fragrance is more or less the same, but I suddenly noticed my hands and face weren't staying as nice as they used to. My family agrees: the cream isn't soothing eczema or flakiness anymore, nor helping prevent dryness. The texture is no longer thick and luscious but feels watery and insubstantial when applied. Once it's rubbed in, skin now seems mildly tacky, not soft or moisturized. Any sensation of moisture wears off quickly. 

I can't tell what they've done to the formula besides the addition of eucalyptus, but it is a catastrophic change. This product used to be five stars, now it's one. A pump bottle of any drugstore brand with oatmeal will serve you much better. I also want to note they have raised the price on the 8oz tube by TWELVE DOLLARS over the last six years - and I'd still be willing to pay if it wasn't worse than a drugstore product.

This is a fairly decent moisturizer. It’s certainly not perfect in my book, but it has some really great qualities. First, I have come to develop mild eczema on my eyelids. Using a small amount around my eyelids has calmed some of the itching and cracking skin. Another redeeming quality is it’s longevity. I live in an aird climate and it’s very difficult to get moisturizer to stick around. This keeps my face soft and mostly hydrated throughout the day. It does a far better job than others I’ve tried (looking at you Tatcha and Drunk Elephant). Third, this is a great price for the quality of product. Especially with the value sets. 

I’m giving this four stars because this product seems to leave a (waxy-like? or silicone-like?) film over my face. I’m not sure how to describe it, but it feels like a residue of sorts. The initial texture is quite dreamy though. Also, I’m not a fan of the smell. Eucalyptus is okay, but it tends to smell kind of stale or perhaps  mildewy. Again, that might not be the correct word. 

Overall this is a great product for the price and if you’re looking for a good moisturizer (and aren’t too picky about shallow details) give this a try!",11

I've been using this FAB cream for almost a decade. I have spent thousands of dollars on just this one cream - I've got a whole family with sensitive skin and we live in an area with very harsh winters. We've bought uncounted tubes and tubs of this stuff (as well as now-discontinued fragrances, rip coconut lime). This used to be the absolute best cream you could buy for a variety of concerns - dry skin, acne, eczema, flakiness, EVERYTHING. The scent was pleasant and the texture, once it sunk in, left your skin actually soft but never greasy and weird. Holy Grail, totally deserving of every accolade it received.

Once it's rubbed in, skin now seems mildly tacky, not soft or moisturized. Any sensation of moisture wears off quickly. 

I can't tell what they've done to the formula besides the addition of eucalyptus, but it is a catastrophic change. This product used to be five stars, now it's one.

I was so excited to buy this because of all the great reviews I've seen for it, and I was pretty disappointed after a week a using it. My biggest complaint is how it pills. It's almost like it's not being absorbed into the skin and sits like a film that will ball up if you touch your face after applying. I tried different ways of applying (using less, using more, patting, rubbing, only rubbing it in for a certain amount of time, etc) and it did it every time. I honestly wouldn't mind it too much if it didn't mess up my makeup application- everything clings to the moisturizer now and looks grainy. My skin does feel softer after using consistently, but like I said earlier, it fills almost filmy. Plus, I don't think it lives up to the ""intense hydration"" name. I looked at recent reviews after I started seeing problems and apparently they changed their formula. My acne has cleared up with this though, and some of my redness has faded, so that's a nice quality of it. Will be returning though, the pilling and weird film feeling isn't worth the price in my opinion.",10

I've been using this FAB cream for almost a decade. I have spent thousands of dollars on just this one cream - I've got a whole family with sensitive skin and we live in an area with very harsh winters. We've bought uncounted tubes and tubs of this stuff (as well as now-discontinued fragrances, rip coconut lime). This used to be the absolute best cream you could buy for a variety of concerns - dry skin, acne, eczema, flakiness, EVERYTHING. The scent was pleasant and the texture, once it sunk in, left your skin actually soft but never greasy and weird. Holy Grail, totally deserving of every accolade it received. 

Welp. Over the last year that's almost all changed. The fragrance is more or less the same, but I suddenly noticed my hands and face weren't staying as nice as they used to. My family agrees: the cream isn't soothing eczema or flakiness anymore, nor helping prevent dryness. The texture is no longer thick and luscious but feels watery and insubstantial when applied. Once it's rubbed in, skin now seems mildly tacky, not soft or moisturized. Any sensation of moisture wears off quickly. 

I can't tell what they've done to the formula besides the addition of eucalyptus, but it is a catastrophic change. This product used to be five stars, now it's one. A pump bottle of any drugstore brand with oatmeal will serve you much better. I also want to note they have raised the price on the 8oz tube by TWELVE DOLLARS over the last six years - and I'd still be willing to pay if it wasn't worse than a drugstore product.

I finally caved and bought the ultra repair cream. It was amazing! The cream was thick, absorbing relatively quickly. It did cause a little burning at first because my hands were so dry and cracked. That subsided after 10 minutes max. I finally saw my skin looking normal and it did take away the small eczema-looking patch on my arm within a week. I was so amazed by this cream, I stocked up and would have anywhere from 5-10+ 14oz jars on hand at any given time and also bought this every year for Christmas for family and friends.

Then I started to noticed the formula was becoming thinner and not working as well as it used to. I noticed my skin going back to the way it was. 

Then the price got outrageous $78 for a 14oz jar? Seems a little excessive for how much cream I was having to use. Then it was getting harder and harder to get their TSV on time for Christmas. Or even at all,  I had it on autodelivery for the Christmas pear fragrance and waited 2 months after it was supposed to ship and kept getting the run around. I finally cancelled it because I got sick of waiting and I haven’t bought another product from them since. Then they stopped selling it!

My two year old daughter has eczema and I have been putting this on her eczema patches because this cream advertises as being a good source of relief for such skin conditions. This product has greatly reduced the amount of irritation on her skin and has been such an amazing alternative to “harsher” creams and medicated ointments. This deserves every five star review it has received and I am so excited I finally tried this product! Will definitely be a staple “must have” in our home from now on!",11

It doesn't have a scent as far as I can tell, and I appreciate that as my nose is very sensitive and certain strong scents can make my asthma act up.

This is a fairly decent moisturizer. It’s certainly not perfect in my book, but it has some really great qualities. First, I have come to develop mild eczema on my eyelids. Using a small amount around my eyelids has calmed some of the itching and cracking skin. Another redeeming quality is it’s longevity. I live in an aird climate and it’s very difficult to get moisturizer to stick around. This keeps my face soft and mostly hydrated throughout the day. It does a far better job than others I’ve tried (looking at you Tatcha and Drunk Elephant). Third, this is a great price for the quality of product. Especially with the value sets. 

I’m giving this four stars because this product seems to leave a (waxy-like? or silicone-like?) film over my face. I’m not sure how to describe it, but it feels like a residue of sorts. The initial texture is quite dreamy though. Also, I’m not a fan of the smell. Eucalyptus is okay, but it tends to smell kind of stale or perhaps  mildewy. Again, that might not be the correct word.

This cream is very lightweight and has a whipped texture. It smells like oats which was weird in the beginning  but I got used to it. It is intended for dry to very dry skin however I didn’t find it hydrating enough. I used it from september to march so basically winter and it wasn’t cut out for this weather. See its ingredients include oat, ceramides, niacinamide, and MANY silicones. The problem with this was that the cream left this residue which was clearly due to the silicones. It was very fast absorbing and I needed alot of product in order to feel moisturized. When I washed my face it felt like there was a layer of cream sitting there so I didn’t like that at all. Also, I think because of the niacinamide there was a BURNING sensation for many days when I first started using it but I got used to it eventually. I’ve never had a cream that lasted me such a short time. I think this cream would suit summers cuz it wasn’t enough for the winter here and summers here get very humid so it would literally just melt off cuz of the silicones.

I’m really upset about my experience with this moisturizer. Back in April of last year, I bought this moisturizer and had the most wonderful experience. It lasted me a very long time as a little always went a long way. After the first batch though, I went to Sephora and bought more and the next day when I put it on my face, my skin no longer liked the product(maybe the second batch was a bad batch) which I found very odd. It feels like my face gets very tight and feels dry and gets very red. I thought maybe I damaged my skin in some way and it was just not working with my skin. However after about 3 months of not using the product, I went back. It still caused a lot of redness, makes my face feel tight and it feels dry. Overall thought the experience was good to begin with but I’m honestly not sure why my skin no longer likes it. I would recommend this product still as I know it works with most people’s skin.

I have only been using these products since August 29th (nearly a month) and am seeing amazing results. My red patches are FINALLY GONE!

The package says ""ultra repair"" and ""intense hydration,"" which are both true but don't mistake that for a heavy cream...it's very light! A little goes a long way and doesn't feel heavy after I put on makeup (although I finally don't feel like I have to wear foundation!). I love the ingredients and they are cruelty free and claim to be vegan, although I haven't looked over the entire brand to verify that.

If you're still worried, try the smaller tube. But you can also use it on other dry skin. I use it every day on my face, elbows, and knees, so I like the bigger option.

Let me start by saying I loved this product so much when I first started using it. My hands, especially during winter, tend to crack and bleed at the knuckles and cuticles especially. I finally caved and bought the ultra repair cream. It was amazing! The cream was thick, absorbing relatively quickly. It did cause a little burning at first because my hands were so dry and cracked. That subsided after 10 minutes max. I finally saw my skin looking normal and it did take away the small eczema-looking patch on my arm within a week. I was so amazed by this cream, I stocked up and would have anywhere from 5-10+ 14oz jars on hand at any given time and also bought this every year for Christmas for family and friends.

Then I started to noticed the formula was becoming thinner and not working as well as it used to. I noticed my skin going back to the way it was. 

Then the price got outrageous $78 for a 14oz jar? Seems a little excessive for how much cream I was having to use. Then it was getting harder and harder to get their TSV on time for Christmas. Or even at all,  I had it on autodelivery for the Christmas pear fragrance and waited 2 months after it was supposed to ship and kept getting the run around. I finally cancelled it because I got sick of waiting and I haven’t bought another product from them since. Then they stopped selling it! So I ended up going back to my old lotions that were less than 1/2 the price for more product.",14

This product is probably a great casual summer moisturizer, but isn't something I'll plan to buy anytime soon. 
I received a 1oz sample product when I purchased the Coconut Skin Smoothie Priming Moisturizer. The instructions on the back say to ""apply as needed from head to toe"" so I decided to try it on my hands since I've been experiencing severe dryness this winter. I like that the product is light, there isn't any strong or aggressive scents, and it absorbs quickly. However, I was disappointed to find that the product didn't do a good job of hydrating my hands. 
I tried it consistently for a few days, to see if longer use would help – but unlike the product description mentions about immediate results, I didn't see the results I anticipated. Eventually, I switched to the Sol de Janeiro Brazilian Bum Bum Cream and I noticed a much bigger improvement in my skin after a few applications. 
I was hopeful that, with a name like ""Ultra Repair Cream"" that this product would be able to refresh my ultra dried skin, but in this case, the name seems to overhype the effectiveness of the product. I can see this as a good summer moisturizer to keep on hand, just in case, but overall, I won't be switching to this product for everyday use.",0

But, I’m so thankful to finally find something for my nightmare skin! 

I also put this on my son’s eczema prone skin on his face. No dry patches for him either.",14

This is without a doubt the best moisturizer I’ve ever used. My skin is sensitive and combination, and this moisturizer always an incredible job. I’m from a hot and humid FL and recently went to a climate where the high was 15 degrees and no humidity. This did an amazing job of keeping my skin hydrated and nourished in the cold winter air, and it honestly helped with the cold weather too. It’s really thick so I reserve it for cold weather and nighttime use, and I think that helped with really locking in the moisture on my face so the cold wasn’t as harsh/noticeable on my skin. A little also goes a really long way, a pea sized amount is good for your face and neck. I got the 8oz and I’ve been using it every night for over a year.

Let me start by saying I loved this product so much when I first started using it. My hands, especially during winter, tend to crack and bleed at the knuckles and cuticles especially. I finally caved and bought the ultra repair cream. It was amazing! The cream was thick, absorbing relatively quickly. It did cause a little burning at first because my hands were so dry and cracked. That subsided after 10 minutes max. I finally saw my skin looking normal and it did take away the small eczema-looking patch on my arm within a week. I was so amazed by this cream, I stocked up and would have anywhere from 5-10+ 14oz jars on hand at any given time and also bought this every year for Christmas for family and friends.

Then I started to noticed the formula was becoming thinner and not working as well as it used to. I noticed my skin going back to the way it was. 

Then the price got outrageous $78 for a 14oz jar? Seems a little excessive for how much cream I was having to use. Then it was getting harder and harder to get their TSV on time for Christmas. Or even at all,  I had it on autodelivery for the Christmas pear fragrance and waited 2 months after it was supposed to ship and kept getting the run around. I finally cancelled it because I got sick of waiting and I haven’t bought another product from them since. Then they stopped selling it! So I ended up going back to my old lotions that were less than 1/2 the price for more product.",14

i don’t understand why fab markets this as a repair cream. it’s a nicely hydrating moisturizer that isn’t thick or greasy and it gets the job done. but the inclusion of eucalyptus oil just ruins the whole moisturizer imo. i’ve been using this for a couple of days, the first time i tried it, it stung a bit around my nose & chin but i ignored it bc i was also exfoliating that night. today, my skin feels very sensitized and my products have started to sting so i’ve decided to stop using it :/ first aid beauty if by any chance you’re reading sephora reviews please remove the eucalyptus oil from this moisturizer it’s defeating the whole purpose of being a repairing cream!!!",0

Let me start by saying I loved this product so much when I first started using it. My hands, especially during winter, tend to crack and bleed at the knuckles and cuticles especially. I finally caved and bought the ultra repair cream. It was amazing! The cream was thick, absorbing relatively quickly. It did cause a little burning at first because my hands were so dry and cracked. That subsided after 10 minutes max. I finally saw my skin looking normal and it did take away the small eczema-looking patch on my arm within a week. I was so amazed by this cream, I stocked up and would have anywhere from 5-10+ 14oz jars on hand at any given time and also bought this every year for Christmas for family and friends.

Then I started to noticed the formula was becoming thinner and not working as well as it used to. I noticed my skin going back to the way it was. 

Then the price got outrageous $78 for a 14oz jar? Seems a little excessive for how much cream I was having to use. Then it was getting harder and harder to get their TSV on time for Christmas. Or even at all,  I had it on autodelivery for the Christmas pear fragrance and waited 2 months after it was supposed to ship and kept getting the run around. I finally cancelled it because I got sick of waiting and I haven’t bought another product from them since. Then they stopped selling it! So I ended up going back to my old lotions that were less than 1/2 the price for more product.",10

This cream quite literally saved my skin.  I had overused my retinol gel because I stupidly didn't look into how to use it properly, and my skin, which is normally oily, became so parched and dehydrated that it was peeling.  My whole face became incredibly sensitive, so much so that my typical gel moisturizer was making my face sting.  The skin on my eyelids were red, irritated and peeling, and my undereyes could not even tolerate concealer.
This cream truly provides ""Intense Hydration"", but is also super lightweight and doesn't leave you feeling greasy.  The colloidal oatmeal really is soothing to my hypersensitivity.

I am so glad I bought this product! The first thing I noticed was the texture. It’s unbelievably light, smooth, airy, and soft. It’s unlike any other cream I have ever felt and it feels amazing on the skin. A little of this cream goes a long way and I find it to be excellent for use on arms, legs, face, elbows, heels... anywhere! It’s super duper hydrating and my skin instantly looks and feels so moisturized and relieved. My husband and I have been so grateful for this product and have been practically bathing in this lately because of the effect the colder, drier weather has had on our skin. Lotions just haven’t done the trick for us and this cream is a lifesaver! My two year old daughter has eczema and I have been putting this on her eczema patches because this cream advertises as being a good source of relief for such skin conditions. This product has greatly reduced the amount of irritation on her skin and has been such an amazing alternative to “harsher” creams and medicated ointments. This deserves every five star review it has received and I am so excited I finally tried this product! Will definitely be a staple “must have” in our home from now on!",15

I developed a really bad heat rash on my face in two different places  (I think the humidity with the mask was disastrous for me-my skin is use to the desert! ) it was so RED, itchy and bumpy!

I wanted to love it, but I just couldn’t. My skin isn’t extremely dry, nor is it oily in the slightest. CeraVe has been my holy grail for years and I just wanted to switch it up. However, anytime I would use this as moisturizer it would end up pilling off of my skin within 30 minutes. Whether I paired it with a primer and skin tint in order to do my makeup, or if I was just doing my skin care routine, it happened every time. If I had put it on before makeup, within that hour I would be having to get all of the pilled product off of my skin with a napkin. I tried so many different combos, stopped using certain products with it, etc. None worked! The only way it stopped was when I stopped using the moisturizer.

I have oily but dehydrated and acne prone skin. I've gotten it under control after lots of trial and error so I am naturally very cautious about introducing new products to my regimen.

I alternate this with other, lighter moisturizers I have but regularly use this one on my neck and throat area to make sure it stays moisturized. I was happy to see that I didn't have any breakouts from this!

This cream is very lightweight and has a whipped texture. It smells like oats which was weird in the beginning  but I got used to it. It is intended for dry to very dry skin however I didn’t find it hydrating enough. I used it from september to march so basically winter and it wasn’t cut out for this weather. See its ingredients include oat, ceramides, niacinamide, and MANY silicones. The problem with this was that the cream left this residue which was clearly due to the silicones. It was very fast absorbing and I needed alot of product in order to feel moisturized. When I washed my face it felt like there was a layer of cream sitting there so I didn’t like that at all. Also, I think because of the niacinamide there was a BURNING sensation for many days when I first started using it but I got used to it eventually. I’ve never had a cream that lasted me such a short time. I think this cream would suit summers cuz it wasn’t enough for the winter here and summers here get very humid so it would literally just melt off cuz of the silicones.

This cream truly provides ""Intense Hydration"", but is also super lightweight and doesn't leave you feeling greasy.  The colloidal oatmeal really is soothing to my hypersensitivity.
After I purchased it (and had stopped using the retinol for 2 days), I applied a thick layer all over my face and continued to reapply every two hours.  It has been less than 24 hours and my skin is no longer stinging, my eyelids have stopped peeling and turning red, and my undereyes are plump.

I think it started with a z or x? Anyway, not important. I specifically purchased because of its raved reviews and well.. what it says in the name ""ultra repair cream"" ""intense hydration"". This did not provide any of those things for my dry face. My face felt more dry and looked so dehydrated 10 min after application. I also think it didn't help with any redness or acne - I think it make it worse.

Let me start by saying I loved this product so much when I first started using it. My hands, especially during winter, tend to crack and bleed at the knuckles and cuticles especially. I finally caved and bought the ultra repair cream. It was amazing! The cream was thick, absorbing relatively quickly. It did cause a little burning at first because my hands were so dry and cracked. That subsided after 10 minutes max. I finally saw my skin looking normal and it did take away the small eczema-looking patch on my arm within a week. I was so amazed by this cream, I stocked up and would have anywhere from 5-10+ 14oz jars on hand at any given time and also bought this every year for Christmas for family and friends.

Then I started to noticed the formula was becoming thinner and not working as well as it used to. I noticed my skin going back to the way it was. 

Then the price got outrageous $78 for a 14oz jar? Seems a little excessive for how much cream I was having to use. Then it was getting harder and harder to get their TSV on time for Christmas. Or even at all,  I had it on autodelivery for the Christmas pear fragrance and waited 2 months after it was supposed to ship and kept getting the run around. I finally cancelled it because I got sick of waiting and I haven’t bought another product from them since. Then they stopped selling it!
